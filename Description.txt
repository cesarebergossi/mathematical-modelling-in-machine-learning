
DESCRIPTION
----------

This dataset is composed of 1100 samples with 20 features each. The first column
is the sample id. The second column in the dataset represents the label. There
are 5 possible values for the labels. The remaining columns are numeric
features.

Your task is the following: you should compare the performance of a Support-
Vector Machine (implemented by sklearn.svm.LinearSVC) with that of Logistic
Regression (implemented by sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression). Try to
optimize both algorithms' parameters and determine which one is best for this
dataset. At the end of the analysis, you should have chosen an algorithm and its
optimal set of parameters: write this choice explicitly in the conclusions of
your notebook.

Your notebook should detail the procedure you have used to choose the optimal
parameters (graphs are a good idea when possible/sensible).
