# mathematical-modelling-in-machine-learning
This repository hosts a Machine Learning Project focused on comparing two unsupervised learning techniques: Support Vector Machine and Logistic Regression. The project's objective is to determine the optimal technique for a given dataset by performing parameter optimization and conducting Exploratory Data Analysis. It was completed as part of the Mathematical Modelling in Machine Learning course in the second year of the BSc program.

The repository includes the project as a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb file), as well as the training dataset and the description of the project. Furthermore, a test dataset (unlabeled) and the corresponding predictions are available for reference.
